# libxxtea-cocos2d-x
xxtea library as distributed by cocos2d-x

Currently the cocos2d-x modified xxtea library can only be accessed by running either a shell script from https://github.com/cocos2d/cocos2d-x-3rd-party-libs-src, a python script from https://github.com/cocos2d/cocos2d-x, or the official cocos2d-x relase at https://cocos2d-x.org.

This repository just serves as a one-place stop for downloading and compiling xxtea as a library -- the CMakeLists.txt is released to the public domain.

The original xxtea code lies at https://github.com/liut/pecl-xxtea.
